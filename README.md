## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both attempt to provide a functional user experience in the event that certain features are not supported/available. 
The goal of graceful degradation is to ensure that some functionalities are still accessible when your network connection fails, when your browser doesn't support certain features, 
etc., the goal is to have some kind of fallback in these scenarios. Service Workers store the corresponding responses to certain requests, and in the event that you cannot connect to 
a network, service workers can use cached assets in order to provide some functionality. The two concepts are rlated because they both involve providing users with some kind of 
functionality in the event that features aren't being supported. In fact, one could say that service workers can be a part of the greater concept of graceful degradaton, because 
it is an example of providing a fallback when connectivity is lost and some features can't be accessed
